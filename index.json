We present a systematic approach for enabling robotic covers to morph their shape, with an overall size fitting the anthropometric dimensions of a humanoid robot. More precisely, we present a cover concept consisting of two main components, a skeleton , which is a repetition of a basic element called node , and a soft membrane , which encloses the cover and deforms with its motion. This article focuses on the cover skeleton and addresses the challenging problems of node design, system modeling, motor positioning, and control design of the morphing system. The cover modeling focuses on kinematics, and a systematic approach for defining the system kinematic constraints is presented. Then, we apply genetic algorithms to find the motor locations so that the morphing cover is fully actuated. Finally, we present control algorithms that allow the cover to morph into a time-varying shape. The entire approach is validated by performing kinematic simulations with four different covers of square dimensions and having 3×3 , 4×8 , 8×8 , and 20×20 nodes, respectively. For each cover, we apply the genetic algorithms to choose the motor locations and perform simulations for tracking a desired shape. The simulation results show that the presented approach ensures the covers to track a desired shape with good tracking performances.","tags":[],"title":"Modeling and Control of Morphing Covers for the Adaptive Morphology of Humanoid Robots","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Affaf Junaid Ahamad Momin","Gabriele Nava","Giuseppe L'Erario","Hosameldin Awadalla Omer Mohamed","Fabio Bergonti","Punith Reddy Vanteddu","Francesco Braghin","Daniele Pucci"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1651536e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651536e3,"objectID":"d7a43a4e24d50f9ead15401f2d736c85","permalink":"https://giulero.github.io/publication/nonlinear-ident-thrust-est-icra/","publishdate":"2022-05-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nonlinear-ident-thrust-est-icra/","section":"publication","summary":"Jet-powered vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) drones require precise thrust estimation to ensure adequate stability margins and robust maneuvering. Small-scale turbojets have become good candidates for powering heavy aerial drones. However, due to limited instrumentation available in these turbojets, estimating the precise thrust using classical techniques is not straightforward. In this paper, we present a methodology to accurately estimate the online thrust for the small-scale turbojets used on the iRonCub - an aerial humanoid robot. We use a grey-box method to capture the turbojet system dynamics with a nonlinear state-space model based on the data acquired from a custom engine test bench. This model is then used to design an extended Kalman filter that estimates the turbojet thrust only from the angular speed measurements. We exploited the parameter estimation algorithm to ensure that the EKF gives smooth and accurate estimates even at engine failures. The designed EKF was validated on the test bench where the mean absolute error in estimated thrust was found to be within 2% of rated peak thrust.","tags":[],"title":"Nonlinear Model Identification and Observer Design for Thrust Estimation of Small-scale Turbojet Engines","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Romualdi Giulio","Stefano Dafarra","Giuseppe L'Erario","Ines Sorrentino","Silvio Traversaro","Daniele Pucci"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1651449600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651449600,"objectID":"1313166f5d26ae5dac80a1a50ca273e4","permalink":"https://giulero.github.io/publication/nn-linear-mpc-icra/","publishdate":"2022-05-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nn-linear-mpc-icra/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper presents a Non-Linear Model Predictive Controller for humanoid robot locomotion with online step adjustment capabilities. The proposed controller considers the Centroidal Dynamics of the system to compute the desired contact forces and torques and contact locations. Differently from bipedal walking architectures based on simplified models, the presented approach considers the reduced centroidal model, thus allowing the robot to perform highly dynamic movements while keeping the control problem still treatable online. We show that the proposed controller can automatically adjust the contact location both in single and double support phases. The overall approach is then tested with a simulation of one-leg and two-leg systems performing jumping and running tasks, respectively. We finally validate the proposed controller on the position-controlled Humanoid Robot iCub. Results show that the proposed strategy prevents the robot from falling while walking and pushed with external forces up to 40 Newton for 1 second applied at the robot arm.","tags":[],"title":"Online non-linear centroidal MPC for humanoid robot locomotion with step adjustment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tong Hui","Antonello Paolino","Gabriele Nava","Giuseppe L'Erario","Fabio Di Natale","Fabio Bergonti","Francesco Braghin","Daniele Pucci"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1651363200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651363200,"objectID":"e2c89a84b9136647a96be77b89f41082","permalink":"https://giulero.github.io/publication/centroidal-aerodyn-icra/","publishdate":"2022-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/centroidal-aerodyn-icra/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper presents a modeling and control frame-work for multibody flying robots subject to non-negligible aero-dynamic forces acting on the centroidal dynamics.

Direct measurements of thrust forces, however, are seldom available in practice and on-line thrust estimation usually follows from the application of fusion algorithms that process on-board sensor data. This letter proposes a framework for the estimation of the thrust intensities on flying multibody systems that are not equipped with sensors for direct thrust measurement. The key ingredient of the proposed framework is the so-called centroidal momentum of a multibody system, which combined with the propeller model. It enables the design of Extended Kalman Filters (EKF) for on-line thrust estimation. The presented approach tackles the additional complexity in thrust estimation due to the possibly large number of degrees of freedom of the system and uncertainties in the propeller model. For instance, a covariance scheduling approach based on the turbines RPM error is proposed to ensure a reliable estimation even in case of turbine failures. Simulations are presented to validate the proposed algorithm during robot flight. Moreover, an experimental setup is designed to evaluate the accuracy of the estimation algorithm using iRonCub, a jet-powered humanoid robot, while standing on the ground.","tags":[],"title":"Momentum-based extended Kalman filter for thrust estimation on flying multibody robots","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giuseppe L'Erario","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

We propose a nonlinear, second order model in order to capture the model jet engines governing dynamics. The model structure is identified by applying sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics, and then the parameters of the model are found via gray-box identification procedures. Once the model has been identified, we approached the control of the model jet engine by designing two control laws. The first is based on the classical Feedback Linearization technique, while the second one on the Sliding Mode control method. The overall methodology has been verified by modeling, identifying and controlling two model jet engines, i.e. P100-RX and P220-RXi developed by JetCat, which provide a maximum thrust of 100 N and 220 N, respectively.","tags":[],"title":"Modeling, identification and control of model jet engines for jet powered robotics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rocco Antonio Romeo","Luca Fiorio","Giuseppe L'Erario","Marco Maggiali","Giorgio Metta","Daniele Pucci"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"cf62dab206be98807b03066f68c0c430","permalink":"https://giulero.github.io/publication/gripper-ral/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gripper-ral/","section":"publication","summary":"Pneumatic grippers are hugely employed in robotic applications. Nonetheless, their control is not easy due to difficulty in managing the pressure inside their air chambers. Pneumatic grippers have often simple structure though the lack of affordable control algorithms complicates their usage. Motivated by these reasons, we wish to deliver a new control architecture for the closed-loop control of pneumatic grippers actuated by pressure regulators. The proposed architecture is composed of a main controller resorting to an optimization algorithm and of a state observer that estimates pressures in both gripper chambers, along with the exerted force. Instead, measured quantities (i.e. physical pressure in the gripper chambers and force recorded by a load cell between the gripper fingers) are used as inputs for the state observer to improve its output. The pneumatic gripper performance benefits from the joint action of the controller and of the state observer, as experimentally demonstrated. The gripper response will be shown for different types of inputs and on different setups.","tags":[],"title":"Dynamic control of a rigid pneumatic gripper","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne Two Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?
